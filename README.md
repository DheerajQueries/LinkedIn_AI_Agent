Step 1: Setting Up Your Project Workspace
-> This first step is crucial because it creates a dedicated and clean space for your project. Think of it like setting up a new, organized workbench before you start building.

Action 1: Create a Project Folder -> LinkedIn_AI_Agent
-> This folder will be the home for all the files related to this project.

Action 2: Create a Virtual Environment
cd path/to/your/linkedin_ai_agent -> Run the command > python -m venv venv
This command creates a "virtual environment" inside your project folder (in a new sub-folder named venv).
